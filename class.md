This page contains the materials for the Tangible Interfaces Senior Industrial Design Studio at Pratt Institute, created by [Steve Turbek](https://turbek.com) in 2025.

The studio focuses on designing with tactile and sensory components to build interactive user experiences embodied in physical products. The studio is built around iterative making with extensive use of 3D modeling and printing.
It will introduce basic electronics using the BBC Microbit, a very simple computer board with a rich sensor package and excellent introductory software. No previous experience of UX or electronics is expected.

We explore the theory and practices of the User Experience Design Process in the context of physical design. Our objects must not only be beautiful; we must have the open mindset to validate our designs with users to improve them.

## Class Schedule

### Project 1: Design a Fidget Toy (Week 1-2)

Warm up design exercise and skills assessment. Feel free to be inspired by the many that exist.  
What feels good? Why?

Class 1

- Intro to class

Homework: Find and 3D print (or make) 1-3 "interesting to feel" fidget toys. Make a slide for each about why it is interesting.

- Purchase basic microbit and electronics components

Class 2

- Class discussion on fidget toys
- Pencil sketching for your ideas

Homework

- Sketch, Sketch, Sketch!
- Remember to 3D print test models early!

Class 3

- In-process presentations & discussion
- Work on final models

Homework: final 3D model & presentation

**Final Presentation**

- Presentations of fidget toys
- In class discussion
- Write documentation and share to 3D sharing sites
- Introduce Project 2

### [Project 2 Media Remote Control Design](project-microbit-media-remote.html) (Week 3-5)

Design Brief: Design and make a working object that can control music/video on your laptop or phone.
